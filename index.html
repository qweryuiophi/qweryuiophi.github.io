  <p> I will also show you the matarials that are needed to make a toast.<p/> 
    
    <p>Anyways, Enjoy!</p>

    <h3>Matarials</h3>
    </ol>
    <li>Toaster (dosn't need to be fancy)</li>
    <li>Electricity</li>
    <li>Bread</li>
    <li>Eggs, Jam, Butter and etc</li>
    <li>Plate</li>
    <li>oven and oven tray If you can't buy an toaster</li>
    <li>Butter knife if you are going to spread butter</li>
    
    <h3>These are the steps.</h3>
    <p>First,put the toaster down and .Plug the electrical connector to the outlet.</p>
    <p>Next, put the bread into the toaster make sure to set the time! 3 minutes and 30 seconds should be good.</p>
    <p>Your bread is toast now!.</p>

    <h3>Extra steps.</h3>
    <p>that's it but you might want to add more these are my suggestions. </p>
  </ol>
  <li>Peanut butter(if you are not allergic)</li>
  <li>ham</li>
  <li>eggs</li>
  <li>Lettuce if you like vegtables.</li>
  <li>nutella</li>
  <li>strawberry jam</li>
  <li>eggs</li>
  <li>Jam</li>
  <li>Butter</li>

  <h1>how to make a toast in the oven</h1>
  </ol>
  <li>Place the bread directly on the baking sheet.</li>
  <li>Place the oven rack in the top third of the oven so it is closer to the heat sourse.</li>
  <li>Take your toast in your pan and place it directly on the oven</li>
  <li>close the door</li>
  <li>Turn the heat on and after 30 seconds flip your toast and put it back in the oven for 40-50 seconds.</li>
  <li>Take out the tray and you have toast!</li>

  <p>It is perfect for spreading butter in my opinion.</p>
